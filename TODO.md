TODO List
=========

Intro
-----

This is small simple list of things that should be created or fixed in next revisions.

When you add/fix some thing that is in this list, just mark it as solved with __+/__ (__plus sign__ followed by a __slash__).

When there is some thing, that has been already discussed and it should be done but it is not in the list, just add it please. You can do it by editing this file, adding newline in the following section **Stuff**, then typing \* (star symbol) and writing/describing thing to do.

Thanks for understanding.
